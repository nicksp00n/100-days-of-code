# 100 Days Of Code - Log (R1)

### Day 1: March 21, 2018 @ 11:15 PM (data logged March 22, 2018 @ 12:33 AM)

**Today's Progress**: I read through the Bootstrap 4.0 docs some and learned things I am going to use for my tribute page on freeCodeCamp. Tomorrow I will setup a carousel and add information to the page so that I can then style it and complete the project.

**Thoughts:** I sort of struggled to understand CSS nesting a while ago but now that I have read into it some more it is starting to make a lot more sense.

### Day 2: March 22, 2018 @ 9:10 PM (data logged March 23, 2018 @ 12:12 AM)

**Today's Progress**: I read through the Bootstrap 4.0 docs some more and figured out how to implement the carousel. I also setup a navbar. 

**Thoughts:** My next goal is to setup an invisible vertical navbar with an icon on the top left that opens up to a menu that spans across the entire webpage with an "x" in the top right corner to close the navbar with 3 choices listed in the center of the screen: Home, About, Code. This is a lot to do. I realize that this is overkill for a tribute page for my first project. I plan to use the things I learn to make my portfolio page look good and feel good on my first try.

### Day 3: March 23, 2018 @ 11:50 PM (data logged March 24, 2018 @ 2:44 AM)

**Today's Progress**: Not much coding today. I was trying to learn how to use gimp to design a mockup for my web project but didn't get far because some plugins weren't working. Then I realized I was running an older version of gimp. Photoshop of some sort would be nice to have.

**Thoughts:** I am not a designer, nor do I want to be one. But with my current knowledge and resources it is the best option.

### Day 4: March 24, 2018 @ 10:31 PM (data logged March 24, 2018 @ 11:43 PM)

**Today's Progress**: I moved around some code trying to make things less responsive (if that makes sense) so that the background doesn't change size to the img-responsive and other things. I basically just inputted too much responsiveness. I thought that was kind of funny.

**Thoughts:** Today was a busy day, but I managed to cram in some work.
