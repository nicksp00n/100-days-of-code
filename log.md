# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 22, 2018 @ 12:33 AM

**Today's Progress**: I read through the Bootstrap 4.0 docs some and learned things I am going to use for my tribute page on freeCodeCamp. Tomorrow I will setup a carousel and add information to the page so that I can then style it and complete the project.

**Thoughts:** I sort of struggled to understand CSS nesting a while ago but now that I have read into it some more it is starting to make a lot more sense.
