# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 21, 2018 @ 11:15 PM (data logged March 22, 2018 @ 12:33 AM)

**Today's Progress**: I read through the Bootstrap 4.0 docs some and learned things I am going to use for my tribute page on freeCodeCamp. Tomorrow I will setup a carousel and add information to the page so that I can then style it and complete the project.

**Thoughts:** I sort of struggled to understand CSS nesting a while ago but now that I have read into it some more it is starting to make a lot more sense.

### Day 2: March 22, 2018 @ 9:10 PM (data logged March 23, 2018 @ 12:12 AM)

**Today's Progress**: I read through the Bootstrap 4.0 docs some more and figured out how to implement the carousel. I also setup a navbar. 

**Thoughts:** My next goal is to setup an invisible vertical navbar with an icon on the top left that opens up to a menu that spans across the entire webpage with an "x" in the top right corner to close the navbar with 3 choices listed in the center of the screen: Home, About, Code. This is a lot to do. I realize that this is overkill for a tribute page for my first project. I plan to use the things I learn to make my portfolio page look good and feel good on my first try.
